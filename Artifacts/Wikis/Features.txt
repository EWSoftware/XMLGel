MAML Editor Features

- No dependencies
	- Sandcastle is not required.  (The MAML editor does not compile help files.)
- WYSIWYM-style editor.  What you see is what you mean (semantically); i.e., actual output may vary depending upon the presentation style used when compiling.
- Seamless integration with Visual Studio 2010 and Visual Studio 11.
- Standalone application works just like Visual Studio if you don't have it installed.
- Supports the Sandcastle Help File Builder (SHFB) Visual Studio add-in, although it's not required.
- Entire MAML schema is supported.  All document types and elements can be used.
- Automatic document fix-up.
