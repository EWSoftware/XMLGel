# XMLGel
XML Gel is my old MAML Editor experiment that was never completed.

This project is not currently under active development. Check the forks for activity.

## Development
To see the current state of development, set the **Testing\DaveSexton.XmlGel.UI** project as the start-up project.

Edit a document by placing the mouse over the margin, allowing you to insert new MAML elements.

(If you load a complex document, it will likely crash while editing.)

Only the basic "Conceptual" MAML document format was intended to be supported at first, but since many of the tags are shared 
with the other document formats, other documents formats may be editable as well.
